# Tasks
1. Spend about half an hour going over the intricacies of the UX prototype to better 
understand various components and how they all interact
    a. Look over what styling has been applied, specifically what images, fonts, and 
colors are used (Is the font bold? What is the Hex color code for that item? Is 
there text overlaying a background image?)

2. Write the HTML for the web site. Account for every element used in the prototype, 
ensuring good, semantic markup is used to define the meaning of your content in 
addition to proving structure (A <div> is helpful as a wrapper, especially when 
positioning a child element, but not every element should be one!).

    a. SEE SETUP STEPS BELOW FOR PROJECT SETUP

3. Write the CSS for the web site. Focus on layout and positioning first (CSS Grid will help 
with this) before moving onto more specific styling. Remember, you should have, at 
minimum, 10 CSS rule sets in your stylesheet (rule = selector + declaration).

4. Once you have completed the required user stories, move on to the bonus stories. 
    a. YOU WILL ONLY RECEIVE BONUS CREDIT FOR RESPONSIVENESS IF YOU UTILIZE 
MEDIA QUERIES IN YOUR STYLESHEET

# Semantic HTML
HTML, contrary to popular belief, has nothing to do with the styling of your content. For 
example, we don’t choose headers to make fonts bigger (that’s what CSS is for). We choose 
elements in HTML that tell the user what the content MEANS. Read below for more!
